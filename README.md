# DevOps Challenge with GitHub and Azure

This repo contains the source code for the DevOps Challenge with GitHub and Azure. The scenario is that a company wishes to evaluate the use of some of GitHub's DevOps tools and how well they work with Azure. Your team will have a limited time to achieve as many of the challenge objectives as possible.

This source code was derived from (Microsoft's ContosoAir demo repository)[https://github.com/Microsoft.ContosoAir] but was intentionally disconnected (i.e., not forked). There are a few differences from the original repo made to support the learnings for this challenge.
